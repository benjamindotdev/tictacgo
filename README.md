# Tic-tac-go

## "Helgo, world"

This is a simple tic-tac-toe clone, built in Go, to get a basic understanding of the language.

Please feel free to fork and play from the command line with ```  go run tictac.go ```

## Check back for future updates!

- GUI with HTMX, perhaps
- Ability to play remotely with a socket connection
